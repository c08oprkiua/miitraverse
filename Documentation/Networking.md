MiiTraverse has two networking node, autoloaded at startup, that manage Account Server and API requests, respectively. 


# Account server design:
1. Determine which base account server URL to access (NN, PN, etc.)
2. Connect to base URL
3. Request suburl:
    1. Encrypt login info
    2. Send login info
4. Mount service token in API loading script

# API loading design: 
1. Determine which network is being used, based on the default network to load
2. Connect to discovery. This is used to validate the login?
3. Get the `api host` URL based on the discovery url
4. Connect
5. Profit
