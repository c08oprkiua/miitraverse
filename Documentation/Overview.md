# Welcome
Welcome to the MiiTraverse docs! I created these so that any developer who would like to contribute or fork this code has a decent, plain English way of getting up to speed on how the app works, including how networking requests are handled, how loading content is handled, and more!


# App overall design
* Networking node for API requests
* Networking Node for account server requests (for retrieving a valid service token)
* Base UI
* Content categories
