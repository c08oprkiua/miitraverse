# Bubbles

All the "bubbles" of the UI elements, whether it's a post, a community, or whatever else, all look the same. Well, that's because they are. They all derive from the same base Bubble class, which is a modified PanelContainer class that automatically handles some things, like properly self freeing, changing the color of the Stylebox, etc.
