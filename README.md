# MiiTraverse
A Miiverse frontend for Android

The end goal of this project is to provide a full frontend for accessing (Miiverse instances)[https://github.com/c08oprkiua/miiverse-android/blob/main/README.md#implementations-that-should-work] on an Android device

# Features:
* ~~existing~~

# Incomplete features: 
* GET requests. It can currently fetch and process:
  * `/v1/communities/`
* Save and swap between different Miiverse implementations on the fly (*mostly* done)

# To-do:
* Downloading images
* Posting

# Implementations that *should* work:
Basically, any implementation that has a working API should work. Some that have said API, as far as I'm aware, include: 
* Juxtaposition (This one is complicated, so support might not be 100% or at all at first)
* NoNameVerse
* Rverse3 (when it's out, at least)
